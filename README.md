# The official Hitch Docker image [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/varnish/docker-hitch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/varnish/docker-hitch)
[Hitch](https://hitch-tls.org/) is a *libev-based* high performance *SSL/TLS proxy* by [Varnish Software](https://varnish-software.com). It is specifically built to terminate TLS connections at high scale and forwards unencrypted HTTP traffic to Varnish or any other HTTP backend.

# How to use this image

Running a Hitch Docker container can be done by using the following command:

```console
docker run --name=hitch -p 443:443 hitch:latest
```

This container will expose port `443`, which is required for HTTPS traffic.

## Configuration file and extra options

Without any argument, the container will run `hitch --config=/etc/hitch/hitch.conf`. You can mount your own configuration file to replace the default one:

```console
docker run -v /path/to/your/config/file:/etc/hitch/hitch.conf hitch
```

You can also change the path of the configuration file by setting the `HITCH_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. You can set it to an empty string to disable the configuration file altogether.

Note that extra arguments can be added to the command line. If the first argument starts with a `-`, the arguments are added to the default command line, otherwise they are treated as a command. 

> Our assumption is that your backend, Varnish or other, supports both *HTTP/2* and the *PROXY* protocol.

## Connecting to Varnish

By default Hitch will connect to Varnish using `localhost:8843` using the [PROXY protocol](https://github.com/varnish/hitch/blob/master/docs/proxy-protocol.md). If your `varnishd` process has been started with `-a localhost:8443,PROXY`, the two will be able to talk together and Varnish will expose the true client IP as `client.ip` in VCL.

But you'll probably run your Varnish in a separate container. In that case, you'll want to change the backend settings in *Hitch*. You can either do that by replacing the [`backend`](https://github.com/varnish/hitch/blob/master/hitch.conf.man.rst#backend--) configuration setting in your mounted configuration file, or by adding a *command-line option*.

Here's how you set the backend via a *command-line option*:

```console
docker run hitch "--backend=[varnish]:8443"
```

## Setting the certificate

The Hitch Docker image comes with a self-signed certificate that is stored in `/etc/hitch/certs/default`. 

This certificate is automatically created during *Hitch* package install, and uses the following command:

```console
make-ssl-cert /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf  /etc/hitch/testcert.pem
```

This is what the `/usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf` looks like:

```
RANDFILE                = /dev/urandom

[ req ]
default_bits            = 2048
default_keyfile         = privkey.pem
distinguished_name      = req_distinguished_name
prompt                  = no
policy			= policy_anything
req_extensions          = v3_req
x509_extensions         = v3_req

[ req_distinguished_name ]
commonName                      = @HostName@

[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints        = CA:FALSE
subjectAltName          = @SubjectAltName@
```

During certificate creation, the `CommonName` and `SubjectAltName` are prompted, and in the in you get a self-signed certificate that is valid for 30 years. The certificate is then copied into `/etc/hitch/certs/default`.

Using a bind mount, you can override the value of the certificate and use your own certificate, which  is advisable.

Here's an example:

```console
docker run -v /path/to/your/certificate:/etc/hitch/certs/default hitch
```

You can also override the [`pem-file`](https://github.com/varnish/hitch/blob/master/hitch.conf.man.rst#pem-file--string) configuration setting in your mounted configuration file.

If you prefer setting the certificate location on the command line, you can add the location as part of the `--backend` option.

Here's how you do this:

```console
docker run hitch "--backend=[varnish]:8443:/path/to/cert.pem"
```
